# File Compression App

A modern, web-based file compression and decompression tool built with React that implements multiple industry-standard algorithms including Huffman Coding, Run-Length Encoding (RLE), and LZ77. This application allows users to efficiently reduce file sizes through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that automatically detects file types and recommends the most suitable compression algorithm for optimal results.

The tool features real-time compression processing, smart file naming conventions, and comprehensive algorithm comparisons to help users understand compression efficiency. Whether working with text documents, repetitive data files, or mixed content, the application maintains data integrity while providing significant file size reductions, making it ideal for both educational purposes and practical file optimization needs.
